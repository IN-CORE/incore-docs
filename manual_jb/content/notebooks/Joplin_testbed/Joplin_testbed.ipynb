Then the failure status of all the buildings is updated by considering their dependencies with the corresponding electric power facilities. Each component generates 500 samples randomly with their failure status determined, and the percentage of building functional and nonfunctional could be calculated using the updated status of the same sample (such as sample #1) for all the buildings, illustrated herein as an example.\n",

For example, the mean percentage of building nonfunctional is around 52%, and the standard deviation percentage shown as an error bar. The percentage is two times more than the percent of building in damage is because three substations fall within the tornado path. Consequently, there is a significant probability for buildings located in their service area cannot be available to access the electric power even though some buildings themselves are still safe and operational in the immediate response of the tornado hazard.
