## Running a Notebook in the Lab

In the [Running Notebook locally](pyincore/running.md) section we described how to run a Building Damage Notebook locally as an example, but you can develop and run all sorts of notebooks as you explore. 
The following section focuses on **step-by-step instructions** of running Notebooks on the IN-CORE Lab.

1. Upload the Building Damage Analysis notebook from your local machine to IN-CORE lab by clicking the `Upload` icon in the left panel and select **building_dmg.ipybn**.

3. Double click to open the Notebook in the main area and run it. For instructions on how to run a **Building Damage Analysis**, please refer to the previous section [Running Notebook locally](pyincore/running.md).
