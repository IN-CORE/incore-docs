# IN-CORE Terms of Service

Last Edited: May 24, 2021

## Overview

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) funded the multi-university five-year Center of Excellence 
for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning ("CoE"), headquartered at Colorado State University, to develop the measurement 
science to support community resilience assessment. Measurement science is implemented on a platform called 
the Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment ("IN-CORE").

By using the IN-CORE software service ("Service"), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions 
("Terms of Service"). IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT 
THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT 
TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES 
AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, 
YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

If any changes are made to these Terms, we will require you to accept these new Terms of Service before you can continue 
to use the Service. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools 
and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes 
shall constitute your consent to such changes.

Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While IN-CORE prohibits such conduct 
and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that IN-CORE cannot be responsible for the Content posted 
on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.

## Account Terms

IN-CORE is broadly available to any researcher or practitioner interested in working in open-source community resilience research. There are three user groups that IN-CORE supports: 

1. CoE members: The primary user group supported by IN-CORE are the CoE members including researchers, faculties, students, post-docs, and NIST researchers
2. CoE collaborators: Second are the CoE collaborators which are recognized and approved by CoE leadership.
3. General public users: Users that don’t fall into the first two categories are general public users. 
   
Other conditions are:

* You must be 13 years or older to use these Services.
* You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
* You must provide your name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.
* Your login may only be used by one person - i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people - except that a machine 
  user's actions may be directed by multiple people. You may create separate logins for as many people as is needed.
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. IN-CORE cannot and will not be liable for 
  any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others 
  who have accounts under your account).
* You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws 
  in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).

## API Terms

Customers may access their IN-CORE account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including 
use of the API through a third-party product that accesses IN-CORE, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following 
specific terms:

* You expressly understand and agree that IN-CORE shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential 
  or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible 
  losses (even if IN-CORE has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API 
  or third-party products that access data via the API.
* Abuse or excessively frequent requests to IN-CORE via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your 
  account's access to the API. IN-CORE, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. IN-CORE 
  will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.
* IN-CORE reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API 
  (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
  
## Cancellation and Termination

* IN-CORE, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current 
  or future use of the Service, or any other IN-CORE service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service 
  will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment 
  of all Content in your Account. IN-CORE reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
* In the event that IN-CORE takes action to suspend or terminate an account, we will make a reasonable effort to provide 
  the affected account owner with a copy of their account contents upon request, unless the account was suspended or terminated 
  due to unlawful conduct.
  
## Modifications to the Service

* IN-CORE reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, 
  the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
* IN-CORE shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

* IN-CORE claims no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your profile and materials 
  uploaded remain yours. However, by setting your materials to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your Content. 
  By setting your spaces to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories.
* IN-CORE does not pre-screen Content, but IN-CORE and its designee have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole 
  discretion to refuse or remove any Content that is available via the Service.
* You shall defend IN-CORE against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against IN-CORE by a third-party 
  alleging that Your Content, or Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates 
  the intellectual property rights of a third-party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify IN-CORE for any damages 
  finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, IN-CORE in connection with any such claim, 
  demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that IN-CORE (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit 
  or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding 
  (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases 
  IN-CORE of all liability); and (c) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.
* IN-CORE will use best practices to keep your content secure and safe, but does not guarantee the availability of your 
  data at all times. You as the content owner are responsible for making sure you have a backup of your data not stored 
  in this Service.
