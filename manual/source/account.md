## IN-CORE Account

Access to the **IN-CORE** service requires a user account provided and operated by the [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) identity management system.
Registering for an account is free and open to everyone. This account gives you access to all of the public data on
the system and allows you to create data that is only accessible by you. If applicable, it is recommended
that you sign up with your institutional email. To register for an account, please go to [Login](https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/login) or [Register](https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/join/BSKC2UKQPU) page:

After you register, you will receive an email to finish your registration process. 
It requires you to use 2 Factor Authentication(2FA) using Duo for making sure that you are not a bot. 
The 2FA is only needed during registration and when changing passwords, it's not required when logging 
in to IN-CORE services or to use pyIncore.
