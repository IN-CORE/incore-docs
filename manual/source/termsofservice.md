obligation to do so. IN-CORE action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential

and Services, by submitting, posting or displaying User Content on or through the IN-CORE Application or Services, 
you grant IN-CORE a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, 
reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute the User Content in any and all media
