Tutorials and Tips
==================

This page contains more in-depth guides for using **pyIncore** and IN-CORE system in general. It is broken up into introductory
and advanced sections.

You may use these tutorials as a self-paced course to learn the platform thoroughly. However, each section is fairly independent,
so those already familiar with pyIncore can jump into any section.

You can also check out IN-CORE resources for other materials to help you navigate through terminology and practices, and a `FAQ section <faq.html>`_ in this Manual.
We encourage IN-CORE users to contribute improve the knowledge base. contact us with suggestions for expanding and extending Tutorials.

More tutorials and tips will be added here soon.
